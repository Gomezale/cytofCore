====Using Automator Applets====
Several automator applets have been included that enable drag-and-drop functionality for certain cytofCore operations. Currently these include
;Subtract100.app
: Subtracts 100 from all FCS file columns except the first two. Supports multiple file drag-and-drop.
;ExtractIMD.app
: Converts binary IMD files to text.
;Concatenate.app
: Concatenates multiple FCS files into a single file.

'''NOTE:''' Files processed by the Automator applets may ''not'' have spaces in their paths, or they will fail.
