==CyTOFCore README 0.02==
===Installation===
The cytofCore package can be installed directly from github using the devtools package. Start R and run the following commands:
 R>install.packages("devtools")
 R>library("devtools")
Now install the cytofCore package
 R>install_github("cytofCore","nolanlab")

===Using Automator Applets===
Several automator applets have been included that enable drag-and-drop functionality for certain cytofCore operations. Download the cytofCore source distribution to use. These should work in Mac OS X 10.6 or later. '''''Files processed by the Automator applets may ''not'' have spaces in their paths, or they will fail.''''' 

Currently applets include:
;Subtract100.app
: Subtracts 100 from all FCS file columns except the first two.
;ExtractIMD.app
: Converts binary IMD files to text.
;Concatenate.app
: Concatenates multiple FCS files into a single file.

Automator Applets are found in:
 cytofCore/src/automator/apps/

===Automator Applet Notes===
* '''Subtract100.app'''
** Drag an FCS onto it to subtract 100 from all columns but the first two.
** You can drag multiple files on the applet and it will subtract 100 from all files.

* '''ExtractIMD.app'''
** Drag an IMD file and corresponding .conf file onto ExtractIMD.app to convert IMD to text.
** Extraction of full IMD files takes a significant amount of time and space. It is likely better to extract relevant portions of the IMD by supplying specific start and end times for extraction. Time limits are in ''milliseconds.'' 

* '''Concatenate.app'''
** Drag multiple FCS files onto Concatenate.app to combine them.
** All FCS files must have identical parameters names and orders.
